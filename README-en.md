## Assignment: 
Create a clone of this repo and setup a webapp wich a multiple-select-filter. See details below. Our goal is to get an idea of how you setup a webapp and overcome technical challenges.

## Given assets:
* JSON file with data entries for the multi-select (470 items)
* Multi-select design
* Search-icon (svg)

## Requirements:
* Show the multi-select and fill it with the given JSON data
* Create a search which can filter the JSON data
* Make it possible to select multiple items
* Selected items need to be ordered on top, also they should not be affected by the search filter
* BONUS: store the selected items locally. They should persist after page reload.

## Primary criteria:
* structured HTML/CSS/Javascript
* JS architecture (ex. MVC pattern)
* HTTP/REST
* ES6 / TypeScript

## Secondary criteria:
* Advanced css (Less/Sass/Responsive/?)
* Data storage
* Build street setup (npm/gulp/webpack/?)

## Takeaways:
* You write well structured code (use common practices / coding patterns)
* It ok if you do not finish the project. Our goal is to get an insight of your skills. Though it helps if (part of) the code works ;)
* You can use a framework you are familiar with (Angular, React), but if you can prove that you know the inner workings of Javascript and are able to reproduce practices that are used in frameworks, that's a definite plus.
* It's a plus if you use Typescript of ES6
* It's a plus if you use TDD or BDD


## Requirements:
* Use structured code (common practices/coding patterns)
* The product doesnt have to be finished, as long as it gives adequate insight into your technical level. That being said, the code should be functional.
* You can use a framework (React, AngularJs) that you are familiar with, however, we would love to see the patterns and mechanisms of these frameworks reproduced in vanilla JS.  
* Use of Typescript or ES6 
* Working with TDD or BDD
